## 👋 Hi, I’m @esterkaufman, a Senior Fullstack engineer.

 🏢 I’m currently working at the `.Net Core 5` fields (MVC / WebApi), `React`, `Angular`, security concepts and communications protocols such as the `OAuth 2`, `CIAM - Customer Identity Access Management`, digital identity, and more.

 
  👀 Also, I'm interested in Machine Learning concepts, theory, and anything related.

  I've projects that I work on, to implement ML models in js for example ( [TensorFlow-Angular-Playground](https://github.com/esterkaufman/TensorFlow-Angular-Playground))
